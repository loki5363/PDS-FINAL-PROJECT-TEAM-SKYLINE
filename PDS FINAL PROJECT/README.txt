Project Title:
Predicting and Analyzing Cyberbullying on Twitter Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Introduction:
Cyberbullying is a prevalent issue on social media platforms. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict and analyze cyberbullying on Twitter.Twitter is one of the most prominent social media platforms where cyberbullying occurs. In this project, our goal is to detect cyberbullying-related posts, chats, and comments from Twitter's dataset. By successfully accomplishing this project, we can identify different types of cyberbullying and classify the texts according to the type of cyberbullying involved


Technologies Used:
Operating Systems: Windows
Coding Language: Python
Tool: Visual Studio Code
Packages: Pandas - 2.0.1, Scikit-learn - 1.2.2

Project Description:
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict and analyze cyberbullying on Twitter. The algorithms used in this project are K-Nearest Neighbor's Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Logistic Regression. The project uses keyword count vectorization to identify keywords commonly used in cyberbullying tweets.

The project follows the below steps:
1. Collect Data: Collect tweets containing cyberbullying keywords using the Twitter API.
2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the collected tweets by removing unnecessary characters, stop words, and punctuations.
3. Feature Extraction: Extract features from the preprocessed tweets using the count vectorizer.
4. Train the Model: Train the machine learning model using the extracted features and labels.
5. Test the Model: Test the model using a testing dataset and evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Analysis: Analyze the model's performance and print the count vectorization of the keywords.

Conclusion:
This project successfully predicts and analyzes cyberbullying on Twitter using machine learning algorithms. The model achieves high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, making it an effective tool for detecting and combating cyberbullying.
